# Adobe Sucks Scrotum
ASS, a website for alternatives to popular Adobe software.

## Got a good alternative?
Please check the website and existing issues, and if your alternative isn't listed, open up an issue with the template and replace text in [brackets].

Note: we are only looking for alternatives that are either free or only take a one-time payment.
